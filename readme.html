<h3 style="padding-bottom: 2em;text-decoration: none;"> A spatio-temporal analysis of NO 2 concentrations during the Italian 2020 COVID-19 lockdown</h3>

<p>The 2020 lockdown led to a reduction of pollutant emissions and possibly to an improvement of air quality. We describe a spatio-temporal statistical model for the assessment of the 2019/2020 relative change in the NO2 concentrations in Italy. We provide a collection of weekly continuous maps, describing the spatial pattern of the NO2 2019/2020 relative changes. As our maps account for the effect of meteorology, our proposal canbe considered as a solution to the weather normalization problem for the study of the lockdown-air quality relationship. We found that during March and April 2020 most of the area is characterized by negative relative changes (median values around -25%), with the exception of the first week of March and the fourth week of April (median values around 5%). As these changes cannot be attributed to a weather effect, it is likely that they are a byproduct of the lockdown measures.</p>
