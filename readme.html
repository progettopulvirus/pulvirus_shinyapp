<h4>The app <i class="fas fa-cogs"></i></h4>

<p>
This <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/">shiny app</a> is intended to provide a collection of weekly continuous maps, describing the spatial pattern of the 2019/2020 relative change in nitrogen dioxide (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_dioxide" title="Nitrogen dioxide" target="_blank">NO2</a>) concentrations in Italy, for the period of March and April during which the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic" title="COVID-19 pandemic" target="_blank">COVID-19</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic_in_Italy" title="Timeline of the COVID-19 pandemic inItaly" target="_blank">lockdown</a> measure was in force.</p>

<hr>

<h4>The maps <i class="fas fa-map-marked"></i></h4>

<p>The maps are the result of a statistical spatio-temporal model able to take into account the effect of weather and other confounding factors, as well as the spatial and temporal correlation existing in the data.</p>

<p>For more information see <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.15020" title="Submitted paper" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h4>The maps and the weather effect <i class="fas fa-smog"></i></h4>

<p>Given that these maps account for <a href="https://theconversation.com/first-lockdowns-effect-on-air-pollution-was-overstated-our-study-reveals-153152" target="_blank" title="Weather effect">the weather effect</a>, the shown reductions across regions and weeks
must be attributed to a factor different from the meteorology. In addition, as these reductions occur in the same period of the restrictive measures it is likely that the COVID-19 lockdown had an effect in the drop of air pollution levels.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, we can not exclude that other factors, not considered in the model, could have had an active role in the NO2 dynamics.</p>

<h4>How the app works</h4>

<p>
<ol>
  
<li>Choose the language (English or Italian) for the app interface</li>

<li>Choose between working days (Monday - Saturday) and weekends (Sunday) raster maps</li>

<li>Select one of the weeks in the period March-April in the drop down menu</li>

<li>Areas where a statistical significant variation at the level of 0.05 occurred can be displayed clicking on "<strong>Significant variation areas</strong>"</li>

<li>Click on one of the monitoring stations in the map (red circles) and see its 2019/2020 relative variations in NO2 concentrations in the "<strong>Station Info</strong>" tab</li>

</ol>
</p>

<h4>The data <i class="fas fa-map-pin"></i></h4>

<p>The 2019 and 2020 raw NO2 hourly data (expressed as &mu;g‚àïùëö<sup>3</sup>), together with monitoring
stations metadata, were extracted from the national database used to store and process the Italian Air quality measurements
(see <a href="https://www.snpambiente.it/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/QUALITA-ARIA-ITALIA.pdf" title="Qualita aria in Italia" target="_blank">SNPA 2020</a>).</p>

<p>The hourly data were measured at stations operated by the local Regional Environmental Protection Agencies, following the European standards EN 14211:2012 for NO, NO2 , and NOX. All ground concentrations were fully validated and daily averages were computed provided that a daily 75% data coverages was achieved (i.e., at least 18 valid hourly records out of 24).</p>

<p>The input dataset for our spatio-temporal analysis includes 546 monitoring sites with a low proportion of missing data (&lt; 25% per station).</p>

<h4>The code <i class="fas fa-code"></i></h4>

<p>Part of the source code of the spatio-temporal model is available through a dedicated <a href="https://github.com/progettopulvirus/A_spatiotemporal_analysis_of_NO2_concentrations" title="github model repository" target="_blank">github repository</a>.</p>
